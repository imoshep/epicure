header (navbar)
======
searchbox's width is set. can I make it more flexible?
the design uses different nams for router links in the navbar-desktop-view and the moblie nav-menu. I want to use the same data for both.
what's the team workflow for questions for graphics?
measure distaces in Zeplin?
i'm really not sure i'd implemented font properly
how would we display images eventually? Because we're using a relative path now. Would we have a strage service?
